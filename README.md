# bit_svcs

Hello,

Okay, Included in this file you should have two folders, ones a website the other is the application.

To run application and website simply import the bit_svcs.sql into your database, versions:

(I'm running the latest xampp)

# Versions:
- phpMyAdmin
- version 4.5.0.2
- Host: 127.0.0.1
- Generation Time: Nov 26, 2015 at 12:22 AM
- Server version: 10.0.17-MariaDB
- PHP Version: 5.6.14


# Logins:

ADMIN:
admin, password

CONTRACTOR/COORDINATOR:
employee, password

CLIENT:
client, password.

# NOTES:

If there is an error while logging into the application there are two buttons Admin Debug and Coordinator Debug, they bypass the login and log you in as either an Admin or Coordinator.
